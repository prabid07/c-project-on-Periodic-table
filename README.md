<b>Author- Prabin Chandra Gautam</b><br>
This allows user to fetch data from modern periodic table and ddisplay the information about the elements using file.
This is one of the simple project that we have made along with my other friends that have helped me here.
on this program, first the user is asked to select the options based on the program and is generally they can select option like select element/ identify the element either from name, symbol number, atomic weight, etc.
it was one of the unique project we have done along with my teammate for ourt first semester of batch 2024.
